# Note Taking React App (Simulated Django API)

This project is a **React frontend** built with **Create React App** and integrated with a **simulated Django backend API**. It demonstrates building a structured, component-based frontend that communicates with an API, handles state management, and provides a responsive interface for managing items like notes, cart items, and dynamic pages.

### Overview

The application simulates typical CRUD operations with the Django API backend. Users can:

- Create, view, and delete items (notes, cart items, etc.).  
- Manage application state through local component state and a centralized store.  
- Interact with a responsive UI built using modular components like Header, Card, NoteItems, CreatePage, DeletePage, and Welcome screens.  

The project showcases **frontend skills**, including React components, CSS modules for styling, event handling, and integration with external APIs.

### Key Features

- Component-based architecture for modularity and reusability.  
- Integration with a simulated Django API to fetch and manipulate data.  
- Responsive layout with clean UI for user interaction.  
- State management using a store pattern for global data handling.  
- Full CRUD simulation with Create, Read, and Delete functionalities.
